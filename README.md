# Battleships

An implementation of the game Battleships with an AI opponent. The opponent can play using a chosen algorithm from 4, each having a higher win rate than the last.

The game is set up using the basic 10x10 board with 5 ships, 
- Aircraft Carrier (5 squares, A)
- Battleship (4 squares, B)
- Submarine (3 squares, S)
- Cruiser (3 squares, C)
- Destroyer (2 squares, D)
These amass a total ship space of 17 squares.

The algorithms used are [clarified here](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/) and further mentioned in this [Vsauce2 video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbALFZoRrw8).
